This github repository contains an implementation of the trapezoidal map.    
To run the code, clone this repository or download the .zip of the repository to your computer.    
Run the driver using ./driver n (with n being the number of random segments to spawn). For now I recommend keeping the number of segments to be less than 1000 (because the spawning algorithm is not really fast).    
The program will continuously prompt for a query point, input them as x y. The output is the top and bottom segment of the trapezoid that contains the point.    
If a segment appears in the result for a query, it is the segment of the bounding box.  
Ctrl C to exit the program.
